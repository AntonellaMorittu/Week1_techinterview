1.
Create a variable and set it equal to ‘variable’.
What are some different data types? Write a few examples.


variable = "variable"
integers, booleans, strings, hashes, arrays

2.
Open irb. We’re going to make some cars.
Create two hashes, one for each car, with the following attributes: wheels, max_speed, color
Create an array that contains both cars.
How do we use the array to access the second car?
How do we find the second car’s color?

car_1 = { "wheels" => 4, "max_speed" => 300, "color" => "red" }
car_2 = { "wheels" => 4, "max_speed" => 310, "color" => "black" }

cars = [ car_1, car_2 ]

cars[1]["color"]
